MySQL is a database management system that allows you to manage relational databases. 
It is open source software backed by Oracle. 
It means you can use MySQL without paying a dime. 
Also, if you want, you can change its source code to suit your needs.

you can buy a commercial license version from Oracle to get premium support services.

or Microsoft SQL Server.

MySQL can run on various platforms UNIX, Linux, Windows, etc. 
You can install it on a server or even in a desktop. 
Besides, MySQL is reliable, scalable, and fast.
